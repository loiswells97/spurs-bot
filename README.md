# spurs-bot

This is a bot to notify me when my football team are playing and update me with goals and final scores when I cannot listen to the match.

## Setup

Use ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install the necessary dependencies. Add the required credentials to a new file named ```config.py``` in the project's root directory. The Spurs Bot app is then started by running ```python3 spurs-bot.py``` from the project's root directory.
